                      <p>Each RD or GRA should contact the Prevention Coordinator before the end of the second week of classes
                        each semester to advise of a desired date for a drill. For the convenience of Residence Hall staff,

                        weather, WCPS will provide access to a nearby campus building.) Immediately preceding the drill,

                        RAs to review proper fire safety and evacuation procedures. RAs are encouraged to ask questions during
                        this meeting concerning specific needs, problems, or clarifications.
                      </p>
                      <p> At the given time, the building fire alarm will be activated and the Public Safety Officer will time
                        the evacuation. RAs should notify the RD or GRA (at pre-arranged locations) when their floors are
                        cleared and the RD or GRA should advise the officer when the entire building is cleared. Residents
                        are not to re-enter the building until an “all-clear” is given from the Public Safety Officer.</p>
                      <p> After the drill, the Public Safety Officer will review the results with the RD or GRA, giving appropriate
                        suggestions for improvement and/or clarification of procedures. The RD or GRA should also communicate
                        observations or specific concerns. RDs, GRAs, ARDs and RAs will be expected to review any clarifications
                        with residents in order to help everyone be better prepared for potential real emergencies.</p>
